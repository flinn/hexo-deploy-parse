18 silly publish   readme: '# Parse.com deployer plugin for [Hexo](http://hexo.io/)\n\nWith this plugin you can deploy your Hexo site be hosted on Parse.com, execute smoketests on your pages/blogposts, increment the values of "settings" objects stored on Parse, and easily extend your build/deployment/rollback process.\n\n**WARNING**: This plugin is only half-baked in many ways. If others show interest, I will contribute more features and fix any issues.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Install\n\n```\nnpm install hexo-deployer-parse --save\n```\n\n### Enable\n\nAdd `hexo-deployer-parse` to `plugins` in `_config.yml`.\n\n``` yaml\nplugins:\n- hexo-deployer-parse\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\nThis explains how to configure your deployment options.\n\n### Quickstart\n\nTo get your started quickly, a **simple** build configuration in your "_config.yml" file might look something like this...\n\n```\ndeploy:\n  type: parse\n  included_folders: [\'assets/img:public/img\']\n  deployment_timeout: 60\n  load_in_browser: true  \n```\n\nThe configuration above would ensure that:\n- The `assets/img` folder will be copied over to `public/img` before your deployment to Parse.com begins.\n- The deployment will throw an error and exit if it does not **complete** in less than 60 seconds. This timeout should include time for generating a build, deploying that build to parse, running all URL tests, and the entire deployment process.\n- After deployment completes your site will be loaded in a new window by your default web browser because `load_in_browser` is set to `true`.\n\n### Parse Settings\n\n**NOTE: This feature hasn\'t been completed as of 2/25/15. The local `settings.json` file *will* be updated when you deploy, but your settings object on Parse.com will not be updated. I\'ll get to this feature soon and update the package when I do.**\n\nIf you\'d like to have the deployer increment settings values locally and on Parse.com as part of your deployment process, the plugin will need access to your Parse.com App\'s `Application ID` and `JavaScript Key`. \n\nAdd these keys to your `_config.yml` file in the deploy settings under the "parse" property as `app_id` and `js_key` respectively.\n\n```\ndeploy:\n  type: parse\n  included_folders: [\'assets/img:public/img\', \'src/cloud_code:cloud\']\n  load_in_browser: true\n  deployment_timeout: 60\n  parse: \n    app_id: <Your Parse.com App\'s ID>\n    js_key: <Your Parse.com App\'s JavaScript Key>    \n    object: appSettings\n    settings_file: config/settings.json\n  url_tests:\n    urls: [\'/home\', \'/about\', \'/contact\']\n    check_posts: true\n    rollback_cmd: hexo rollback  \n```\n\nAs you can see above, there are also a couple other options included in the parse settings within the "_config.yml" file like `object` and `settings_file`.\n\n**object**: This is the name of the Parse.com "Object" in which you want your app\'s deployment settings object stored. This allows your server side code to be aware of the last time it was successfully deployed to and allows you to track the version of your site based on how many times you have deployed it.\n\n**settings_file**: This is the relative path to the local file where deployment settings will be updated/stored. (**NOTE**: This file will need to be created initially by you! Sorry, I\'m lazy.)\n\nYou should create a file at this path that looks like this to start...\n\n```\n{\n  "name": "",\n  "version": 0,\n  "last_deployed": ""\n}  \n```\n\nThese values will be updated for you automatically upon each deployment.\n\n### URL Tests\n\nIf you\'d like for the deployer to check the status of your pages after deployment, include these options in your `_config.yml` file...\n\n```\ndeploy\n  type: parse\n  deployment_timeout: 70\n  url_tests:\n    urls: [\'blog/\', \'about/\', \'projects/\', \'contact/\',]\n    check_posts: true\n    rollback_cmd: hexo rollback\n```\n\nThese options tell the deployer which (relative) URLs to check after your deployment has completed to ensure that your pages still work. This just pings each and ensures that an HTTP status code of 200 is returned. \n\nIf you have set `check_posts` to `true`, the deployer will also trigger a custom hexo "generator" that creates a file called `list.json` in the `public/deployer/posts/` folder of your project that will contain a list of all your posts including their `title` and `permalink` attributes. It will test all of your post\'s URLs to ensure that they have an HTTP status code of 200 as well.\n\nIf you\'ve set a `rollback_cmd`, this command will be run in the event that any of your URL tests fail. I suggest creating a custom script that will roll your site back to the previous (and hopefully working) version.\n\n### Included Folders\n\nThis is where you specify the folders that you\'d like to have included in your deployment to Parse. The syntax for including folders is to add the source and destination paths, seperated by a colon (:), to an array like this: `[\'<path_to_source_folder>:<path_to_destination_folder>\', etc, etc...]`\n\n### Browser Load\n\nThis can be `true`, `false`, or a URL like `http://your-app-name.parseapp.com`. This tells the deployer to open your browser and navigate to either your hexo configuration\'s root URL or to the URL that you specify once deployment is complete. Set this value to `false` if you\'d prefer that it didn\'t open your browser for you.\n\n### Deployment Timeout\n\nThis is the amount of time, in seconds, that the deployer will wait for the deployment to Parse.com to be completed before it assumes that the deployment has failed and exits.\n\n## Removal & Updates\n\n### Disable\n\nRemove `hexo-deployer-parse` from `plugins` in `_config.yml`.\n\n``` yaml\nplugins:\n- hexo-deployer-parse\n```\n\n### Update\n\nExecute the following command.\n\n```\nnpm update\n```\n\n### Uninstall\n\nExecute the following npm command. (Don\'t forget to disable the plugin by removing it from your `_config.yml` file\'s plugin list in addition to uninstalling the npm package, otherwise Hexo will yell at you...)\n\n```\nnpm uninstall hexo-deployer-parse\n```\n\n\n[Hexo]: http://hexo.io',
